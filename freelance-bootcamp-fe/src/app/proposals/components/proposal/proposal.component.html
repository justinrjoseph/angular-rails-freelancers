      <p>Hi {{ proposal.customer }}</p>
    
      <p>
        It was a pleasure meeting you and reviewing your project requirements. I believe it is a great fit for the skill set I have in building applications. Please feel free to check out some of my past projects <a [href]="proposal.portfolio_url" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        To successfully build your project, I will be utilizing {{ proposal.tools }}... and a number of other tools to ensure that the project follows industry-wide best practices.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Ensuring that you're fully informed is one of my top priorities, so in addition to incorporating everything that we discussed, I will also create a project management dashboard. I will daily send you a project update message so that you have a transparent view of the development as it takes place.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I estimate that it will take {{ proposal.estimated_hours }} hours to meet the requirements we discussed and finish the project. The project should take {{ proposal.weeks_to_complete }} weeks to complete, and with my hourly rate of {{ proposal.hourly_rate | currency:'USD':true }}, the estimated total is {{ proposal.estimated_hours * proposal.hourly_rate | currency:'USD':true:'.0' }}.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The next step is to set up a meeting to finalize the project and sign contracts.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I am excited to work with you and build this application!
